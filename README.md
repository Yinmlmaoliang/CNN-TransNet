# Cross-Level Multi-Modal Feature Learning with Transformer for RGB-D Object Recognition
## Introduction
This repository presents the implementation of CNN-TransNet for RGB-D object recognition. The overall
architecture employs two CNN streams to extract multi-modal feature representations from multiple layers of CNN and 
Transformer to encode these features into  highly discriminative representation.
